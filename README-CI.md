PART 1. 
  After installing Docker(and any of the other things it needs to work), I create a Dockerfile (included in the repo) that will create an apache2 image in a dockerized container, and copy the contents of my website's 'index.html' to the htdocs folder in the apache directory of the container we are going to make. I then build the image by typing "sudo docker build -t apache-docker .", then get the container running by typing "sudo docker run -d --name httpd-docker-01 -p 80:80 apache-docker", which gets the container we made running an apache server hosting our website on port 80. Once I've confirmed its working by checking the website in my browser, I then type "sudo docker stop 0a430ac31b02be6ec7056205f436fd101c390579815d704478f67ba3774b22c7" to stop the container from running.
